Summary of source

## Tutorials

### https://machinelearningmastery.com/start-here/#algorithms

This website contains tons of step-by-step guides (foundations, beginner, intermediate, and advanced level) which are really to getting a quick. brief overview of certain topics. I personally find the courses under "Understand ML Algorithms" especially useful in providing a useful overview on what certain ML algorithms do. It also contains more advanced guides on specific ML algorithms as well.

### https://mlfromscratch.com/tag/machine-learning/

Very clean and sleek website with short 10+ minute read articles on ML, applying ML algorithms in python, etc.
