Summary of source

## Tutorials

### https://machinelearningmastery.com/start-here/#algorithms

This website contains tons of step-by-step guides (foundations, beginner, intermediate, and advanced level) which are really to getting a quick. brief overview of certain topics. I personally find the courses under "Understand ML Algorithms" especially useful in providing a useful overview on what certain ML algorithms do. It contains more advanced guides on more specific ML algorithms.

This youtube channel `3blue1brown`, has a set of 4 videos in a series dedicated on deep learning topics, neural networks, and backpropagation that a lot of people seem to be raving with compliments like "vividly clear explanations of very tricky subjects."
