This website contains tons of step-by-step guides (foundations, beginner, intermediate, and advanced level) which are really to getting a quick. brief overview of certain topics. I personally find the courses under "Understand ML Algorithms" especially useful in providing a useful overview on what certain ML algorithsm do. It contains more advanced guides on more specific ML algorithms.
